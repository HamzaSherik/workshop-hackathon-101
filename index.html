            <!-- source: wikipedia -->
            One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, Hopper
            was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first
            compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of
            machine-independent programming languages, which led to the
            development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still
            in use today.

            During the war in 1943, Hopper was sworn into the United States Navy
            Reserve. She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve
            Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.
            Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the
            Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a
            lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer
            programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken
            co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic
            Sequence Controlled Calculator.
