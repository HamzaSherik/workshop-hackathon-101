A brief introduction to web development

## What we'll learn

- Core web technologies (HTML5, CSS3)
- Responsive design
- Accessibility

## Getting started

- [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- If on Windows, install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Log in or [sign up for GitHub](https://GitHub.com/join)
- Once logged in to GitHub, fork this repository (top right)
- Create a new folder for your website (on your Desktop for example)
- Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
- Enter "ctrl + \`" to open the terminal
- If on Windows, enter `bash`
- Go to your browser and click "Clone or download" on the top right of your forked repository and copy the URL
- In Visual Studio Code's terminal, type `git clone URL .`
  - where `URL` is replaced by the URL you just copied
- Right click `index.html` and select "copy path"
- Paste that path in your browser URL bar and press enter
- Make a change to `index.html` and reload the page!

## Validating your code

- General structure: `npm run validate`
- Accessibility: `npm run accessibility`
